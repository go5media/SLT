        <section class="HO1">
            <h2>Origins of SOX Lighting</h2>
            <p>SOX lighting, also known as low-pressure sodium lighting, was first developed in the early 20th century. It was designed as an energy-efficient solution for public lighting in urban areas, highways, and industrial zones. Its signature monochromatic yellow glow became synonymous with nighttime cityscapes.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Evolution and Adoption -->
        <section class="HO1">
            <h2>Evolution and Widespread Adoption</h2>
            <p>Over the decades, SOX lighting technology evolved significantly. Advances in manufacturing and design improved its efficiency and lifespan. By the mid-20th century, SOX lighting had become the preferred choice for municipalities worldwide due to its unmatched energy efficiency and ability to penetrate fog and mist.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Iconic Features -->
        <section class="HO1">
            <h2>What Made SOX Lighting Iconic?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distinct Yellow Glow:</strong> SOX lamps emit a monochromatic yellow light that is highly visible in poor weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> SOX lamps are among the most efficient lighting solutions, with a luminous efficacy of up to 200 lumens per watt.</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Their robust design made them a reliable choice for long-term outdoor applications.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section 4: Decline and Legacy -->
        <section class="HO1">
            <h2>Decline and Enduring Legacy</h2>
            <p>With the advent of LED lighting in the 21st century, SOX lighting saw a decline in popularity. LEDs offered a broader color spectrum and greater design flexibility. Despite this, SOX lighting remains a nostalgic symbol of mid-century urban development and continues to be cherished by collectors and enthusiasts.</p>
